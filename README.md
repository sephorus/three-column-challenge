# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My solution to the 3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor.
Built on HTML and SASS, using Gulp to automate tasks like (running a local server,
minifying code, optimizing images, preprocessing CSS, etc.).

## Installation

General guide to installing everything you need to run this on your machine

### **NVM, NPM and Node**

Install Node Version Manager (NVM) This tool lets developers install multiple versions of Node, and easily switch between them.

```bash
nvm install node
```

The command above also installs Node's package manager (npm). Check both are these are installed by running the following commands
on the command line:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### **Gulp**

Gulp's command line tool should also be installed globally.

```bash
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

In the gulp file, there is a Gulp task defined called "watch:sass". Run this to listen to SASS file changes for CSS compilation

```bash
gulp watch:sass
```
